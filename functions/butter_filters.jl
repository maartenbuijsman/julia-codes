"""
    bandpass_butter(y,Tl,Th,dt,N)

Bandpass butterworth filter, returns filtered time series.
filtfilt is always applied along the first dimension of multi-dim. arrays.

# Arguments
y: time series that needs to be filtered.

Tl, Th: low and high cutoff periods. 

dt: delta-t.

N: order of the filter.

Make sure all the time variables have the same time units!   

# Example: 9-15 hour bandpass filter for 1 cph sampling (Δt=1hour)
yf = bandpass_butter(y,9,15,1,4)

"""
    lowhighpass_butter(y,Tcut,dt,N,fstring)

Low/high-pass butterworth filter, returns filtered time series.
filtfilt is always applied along the first dimension of multi-dim. arrays.

# Arguments
y: time series that needs to be filtered.

Tcut: low or high-pass cutoff period. 

dt: delta-t.

N: order of the filter.

fstring: "low" or "high"

Make sure all the time variables have the same time units!
